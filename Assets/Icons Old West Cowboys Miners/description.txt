Richly detailed, hand-painted icons suitable for a strategy game, RPG, or boardgame-like experience.

- 64 icons (so far!)
- all icons are 128x128 pixels
- provided on a transparent background
- icons are provided both as individual PNG files and on a 1024x1024 sheet
- yeehaw!

This set is made up of old west items useful to everyone on the frontier, from cowboys, to gold miners, and perhaps even the new sheriff in town.
Feel free to email me and suggest more icons if you have any ideas! I have a few ideas myself, and have plans to create icon sets for other themes & genres.

Icons are provied both as icons in individual files and as a sheet.
